# uptimejson

A simple CLI tool written in Go that logs your system uptime into JSON files.  
Each run records the current uptime and appends it into a monthly JSON log.  
This makes it easy to track system usage, analyze uptime history, or integrate with other tools.

## Features

- Logs system uptime (hours + minutes).
- Optionally include the current date and/or timestamp in each entry.
- Stores logs in `~/.local/share/uptimejson/YYYY-MM.json` (one file per month).
- Keeps user settings in `~/.config/uptimejson/config.json`.
- Lightweight and fast â€” reads directly from `/proc/uptime`.
